            <h1>coolie</h1>
            <p> Origins: The term likely originates from the Hindi and Telugu word kulÄ«, meaning "day-laborer", and may be associated with the Urdu word quli, meaning "slave". It was first used by European traders in the 16th century and became commonly used for migrant Indian indentured laborers by the 18th century.
The Coolie Trade: During the British colonial era in the 19th century, the term was used for transporting and employing Asian laborers under contract on sugar plantations to replace the previously enslaved African workforce. This system is often compared to slavery, with instances of kidnapping, forced labor, and harsh conditions.
Abolition of slavery and rise of coolie trade: The abolition of slavery led to a demand for cheap labor, resulting in the large-scale trade of Indian and Chinese indentured laborers in the 1820s.</p>
