        <p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town 
            in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph,
             of the House of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. He went in and said
             to her, 'Rejoice, you who enjoy God's favour! The Lord is with you.'
             She was deeply disturbed by these words and asked herself what this greeting 
             could mean, but the angel said to her, 'Mary, do not be afraid;
             you have won God's favour. Look! You are to conceive in your womb
              and bear a son, and you must name him Jesus.</p>
