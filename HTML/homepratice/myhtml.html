                <p>Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed
                     by Steven Spielberg and written by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, 
                     based on Crichton's 1990 novel. Starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, 
                     Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough, the film is set on the 
                     fictional island of Isla Nublar near Costa Rica, where wealthy businessman 
                     John Hammond (Attenborough) and a team of genetic scientists have created 
                     a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. When industrial sabotage leads to 
                     a catastrophic shutdown of the park's power facilities and security precautions,
                      a small group of visitors struggle to survive and escape the now perilous island.

                     Before Crichton's novel was published, four studios put in bids for its film rights.  
                     With the backing of Universal Pictures, Spielberg acquired the rights
                     for $1.5 million. Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt
                     the novel for the screen. Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much 
                     of the novel's exposition and violence, while making numerous changes to 
                     the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii from August to
                     November 1992, and post-production lasted until May 1993, supervised by 
                     Spielberg in Poland as he filmed Schindler's List. The dinosaurs were created  
                     with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic, 
                     and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team.
                     To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various
                     animal noises for the dinosaur sounds, Spielberg invested in the creation 
                     of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. The film 
                     was backed by an extensive $65 million marketing campaign, which included 
                     licensing deals with over 100 companies.

                     Jurassic Park premiered on June 9, 1993, at the Uptown Theater in Washington,
                     D.C., and was released two days later throughout the United States. It was 
                     a blockbuster hit and went on to gross over $914 million worldwide in its
                     original theatrical run,[5] surpassing Spielberg's own E.T. the Extra-
                     Terrestrial to become the highest-grossing film of all time until the 
                     release of Titanic (1997), surpassing it in early 1998.[6] The film received
                     critical acclaim, with praise to its special effects, sound design, action
                     sequences, John Williams's score, and Spielberg's direction.[7] The film 
                     won 20 awards, including three Academy Awards for technical achievements 
                     in visual effects and sound design. Following its 20th anniversary 
                     re-release in 2013, Jurassic Park became the oldest film in history to 
                     surpass $1 billion in ticket sales and the 17th overall.</p>

            <li>The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 American science fiction action film directed 
                by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by David Koepp.[5] It is the second installment 
                in the Jurassic Park franchise and the original Jurassic Park trilogy. A sequel 
                to 1993's Jurassic Park, it is loosely based on Michael Crichton's 1995 novel The 
               
                Lost World. Jeff Goldblum along with Richard Attenborough, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana 
                Richards reprise their roles from the original film with Julianne Moore,
                 Pete Postlethwaite, and Arliss Howard joining the cast.</li>

               <li>Four years after the original film, John Hammond (Attenborough) loses control
                of his company InGen to his nephew, Peter Ludlow (Howard). On the verge of bankruptcy,
                Ludlow intends to exploit dinosaurs from InGen's second island, Isla Sorna, 
                with plans for a new dinosaur theme park in San Diego. Hammond sends a team,
                led by the eccentric chaos theorist and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum),
                to the island to document the dinosaurs and encourage non-interference,
                although the two groups eventually come into conflict.</li> 

               <li>After the original novel's release and the first film's success,
              fans pressured Crichton for a sequel. Following the book's
               publication in 1995, production began on a film sequel. Filming took 
              place from September to December 1996, primarily in California, with a
             shoot in Kauai, Hawaii, where the first film was shot. The Lost World's plot 
             and imagery is substantially darker than Jurassic Park. It makes more extensive
              use of CGI to depict the dinosaurs, along with life-sized animatronics.

            The Lost World was among the most anticipated films of the year.
            It was accompanied by a $250 million marketing campaign,
            which included video games, comic books, and toys.
            Released on May 23, 1997, the film received mixed reviews from critics, 
            who praised the visual effects but criticized the character development.
            Spielberg also expressed disappointment with the film, stating he had
            become increasingly disenchanted with it during production.
            It grossed $618.6 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing
            film of 1997. It was nominated for numerous awards, including an
             Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A sequel, 
             Jurassic Park III, was released in 2001. Goldblum would 
             later reprise his role as Malcolm in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) 
            and Jurassic World Dominion (2022).</p></ul>

            <p>Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American science fiction action film directed by 
                Joe Johnston and written by Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor.[5] 
                It is the third installment in the Jurassic Park franchise and the final 
                film in the original Jurassic Park trilogy, following The Lost World: 
                Jurassic Park (1997). It is also the first film in the franchise not
                 to be directed by Steven Spielberg, as well as the first not to be based
                  on a novel by Michael Crichton; however, the film features characters
                   and ideas by Crichton. It stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, 
                   Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan and Michael Jeter, with brief appearances 
                   by Laura Dern. Neill and Dern reprise their roles from the first film as
                    Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler. The plot involves a divorced couple who,
                     via subterfuge, enlist the help of paleontologist Dr. Grant to find 
                     their son, who has gone missing on Isla Sorna.



Alan reluctantly agrees, flying there with Billy, two of the Kirbys'
 mercenary associates, Udesky and Cooper, and their pilot, 
 Nash. When the Kirbys try to have Nash land the plane,
  Alan protests and is knocked unconscious by Cooper. He awakens to 
  find they have landed, and the Kirbys refuse to leave, until a Spinosaurus
   approaches them. They attempt to escape but the dinosaur attacks their 
   plane during take-off and kills Cooper. The plane crashes in the forest,
    and the Spinosaurus kills Nash and swallows Paul's satellite phone.
     The survivors
     flee, encountering a Tyrannosaurus, which is promptly 
     defeated by the Spinosaurus as the humans escape.

The Kirbys reveal they are a divorced, middle-class couple
 searching for their son Eric and Amanda's boyfriend Ben Hildebrand,
  who have been missing for eight weeks and were last seen
   illegally parasailing by the island. Government agencies 
   declined to help so they deceived Alan to secure his assistance,
    mistakenly believing he had experience on Isla Sorna. 
    The group searches for Eric and Ben, finding the latter's 
    corpse attached to the parasail near a velociraptor nest.
     They discover the InGen compound, where they are attacked by a 
     pack of Velociraptors, who kill Udesky. Alan is separated from the 
     rest of the group but is saved from the raptors by Eric, who has been 
     sheltering in a supply truck.

The following morning, Alan and Eric reunite with Billy and Eric's 
parents and narrowly escape the Spinosaurus again. Alan finds Billy 
stole Velociraptor eggs, which resulted in the earlier attacks. 
Billy hoped to sell the eggs to fund their dig site,
 which Alan disapproves of, but keeps the eggs regardless, 
 hoping the Velociraptors may spare the group if they are returned.
  The group enters an aviary and is attacked by a flock of Pteranodons,
   one of which takes Eric to its nest to feed him to its young;
    Billy rescues Eric using the parasail but is seemingly killed
     while the rest escape by boat along an adjacent river. 
     They retrieve the satellite phone and Grant contacts Ellie for 
     help while they are attacked once again by the Spinosaurus.

The following day, the group hears a helicopter overhead and arrives 
at the coast, but are ambushed by the Velociraptors, who have come for 
the eggs. Alan, finding the replicated larynx in Billy's bag, uses it
 to confuse the pack. Upon hearing distant helicopters, the raptors 
 reclaim their eggs and retreat. The U.S. Marines and Navy, summoned
  by Ellie, land on the beach and rescue the survivors. On a helicopter, 
  they discover that an injured Billy has also been rescued. They watch 
  the now-freed Pteranodons fly alongside them as they leave the island.</p>

            <p>Jurassic World is a 2015 American science fiction action film directed 
                by Colin Trevorrow, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa,
                 Amanda Silver, and Derek Connolly from a story by Jaffa and Silver.
                 [5] It is the first installment in the Jurassic World series and the 
                 fourth installment overall in the Jurassic Park film series, following 
                 Jurassic Park III (2001). It stars an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt,
                  Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, 
                  BD Wong, and Irrfan Khan; Wong reprised his role from the original Jurassic Park
                  film. Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, the film takes place
                  on the same fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off the Pacific coast 
                  of Costa Rica. A successful theme park of cloned dinosaurs, dubbed 
                  Jurassic World, has operated on the island for years, bringing 
                  John Hammond's dream to fruition. The park plunges into chaos when 
                  a transgenic dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage.

    Three sequels have been released, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), 
    Jurassic World Dominion (2022), and Jurassic World Rebirth (2025).</p>

                <p>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a 2018 science fiction action
                 film directed by J. A. Bayona and written by Derek Connolly 
                 and Colin Trevorrow.[9] The sequel to Jurassic World (2015), 
                 it is the second installment in the Jurassic World series and 
                 fifth overall of the Jurassic Park film series. Chris Pratt, 
                 Bryce Dallas Howard, BD Wong, and Jeff Goldblum reprise their
                 roles from previous films in the series, with Toby Jones, Ted 
                  Levine, and Rafe Spall joining the cast. The story follows
                   Owen Grady and Claire Dearing as they return to the fictional
                    Central American island of Isla Nublar to rescue the remaining 
                    dinosaurs from an impending volcanic eruption, only to discover 
                    a mercenary team's ulterior motives to bring them to the US mainland.

                  Filming took place from February to July 2017 in the United Kingdom 
                  and in Hawaii. With a production budget of up to $432 million,
                   Fallen Kingdom is the second-most expensive film ever made.
                    Fallen Kingdom premiered at the WiZink Center in Madrid on 
                    May 21, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States
                     on June 22, by Universal Pictures. The film grossed over
                      $1.3 billion worldwide, making it the third Jurassic film 
                      to pass the billion-dollar mark, and was the third-highest-grossing
                       film of 2018 and the 12th-highest-grossing film of all time. 
                       It received mixed reviews from critics, who generally praised
                        the visuals, cinematography, music and darker tone, while others
                         criticized the screenplay.[10] A sequel, titled Jurassic World
                          Dominion, was released in June 10, 2022.</p>

            <P>Jurassic World Dominion is a 2022 American science fiction action film directed 
                by Colin Trevorrow, who co-wrote the screenplay with Emily Carmichael. 
                It is the sixth installment in the Jurassic Park film series, concluding 
                the original storyline that began with Jurassic Park (1993). Chris Pratt,
                 Bryce Dallas Howard, BD Wong, and Omar Sy reprise their roles from the
                  previous films, along with Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill, who appear
                   together for the first time since the original Jurassic Park. Also joining
                    the cast were DeWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie.

<b>The film is set four years after the events of Jurassic World:</b>

            Fallen Kingdom,
 with dinosaurs and other de-extinct prehistoric animals now living alongside
  humans around the world. It follows Owen Grady and Claire Dearing as they embark 
  on a rescue mission, while Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm work to expose
   a conspiracy by the genomics corporation Biosyn. Planning for the film began in 2014, 
   before the release of the first Jurassic World film. Filming took place from February to
    November 2020 in Canada, England, and Malta. With an estimated budget of $185–265 million,
     it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
     filming was suspended for several months and the release was delayed by a year.

Jurassic World Dominion premiered in Mexico City on May 23, 2022, and was released 
in the United States by Universal Pictures on June 10. It received 
generally negative reviews from critics, although an extended edition,
 included with the home media release, was met more positively. Like its predecessors,
  the film was a financial success and grossed $1 billion worldwide, becoming the
   third-highest-grossing film of 2022. A standalone sequel, Jurassic World Rebirth,
    was released on July 2, 2025.

Claire Dearing, Zia Rodriguez, and Franklin Webb investigate illegal dinosaur
 breeding sites, also gathering proof of cases of animal cruelty. Claire's partner, 
 Owen Grady, helps relocate stray dinosaurs. At their remote cabin in the Sierra 
 Nevada mountains, Claire and Owen secretly raise 14-year-old Maisie Lockwood 
 (Benjamin Lockwood's biogenetic granddaughter) and protect her from groups
  seeking to exploit her unique genetic makeup.

When Blue, the Velociraptor Owen raised and trained, arrives at the 
cabin with an asexually-reproduced hatchling, Maisie names it Beta. Increasingly 
frustrated living in seclusion, Maisie sneaks away to explore. Mercenaries searching
 for Maisie find and kidnap her and capture Beta.</P>

            <p>Jurassic World Rebirth is a 2025 American science fiction action thriller film directed 
                by Gareth Edwards and written by David Koepp. A standalone sequel to Jurassic 
                World Dominion (2022), it is the fourth Jurassic World film and the seventh 
                installment overall in the Jurassic Park franchise. The film stars Scarlett Johansson, 
                Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and Ed Skrein.

Work on the film began shortly after the release of Jurassic World Dominion, 
when executive producer Steven Spielberg recruited Koepp to help him develop 
a new installment in the series. Koepp previously co-wrote the original Jurassic Park 
film (1993) and wrote its sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). 
Development of Rebirth was first reported in January 2024. Edwards was hired as director 
a month later, and casting commenced shortly thereafter. Principal photography took place
 in Thailand, Malta, and the United Kingdom from June to September 2024.

Jurassic World Rebirth premiered on June 17, 2025, at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London,
 and was released in the United States and Canada by Universal Pictures
  on July 2. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with some deeming 
  it an improvement over previous entries. It has grossed over $390 million 
  worldwide against a budget of $180 million, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2025.

  Martin Krebs, an executive at pharmaceutical company ParkerGenix, recruits Zora Bennett, 
an ex-military covert operative, to collaborate with paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis on
 a top-secret mission to retrieve biomaterial samples from the three largest remaining 
 prehistoric specimens, which hold the key to a new heart disease treatment. In a bar 
 in Suriname, Zora recruits her longtime friend Duncan Kincaid to lead the expedition.
  He brings boat driver LeClerc, mercenary Nina, and security chief Bobby Atwater.</p>
