                <p>My father is good men and simple man ,my real hero my dad
                    From the first step I took to the dreams 
                    I now chase, one name has always stood strong behind me —
                     Appa. He may not wear a cape, but his silent sacrifices,
                     endless support, and unconditional love make him
                     the greatest hero of my life.</p>

                <p>From wiping my tears to scolding me like Amma,
                   From protecting me like a warrior to loving me like no one else could —
                    She has always been there.

                    When Amma wasn't around, Akka stepped in.
                    When I was lost, she showed the way.
                    When I made mistakes, she corrected me — not with anger, but with care.</p>

                   And cheering me on when I didn’t believe in myself.</p>
