            <p>Heatblast is a plasma-based life-form humanoid alien whose body is composed of a super hot inner plasma 
                body covered by dark reddish brown volcanic rocks.[
            He is seven feet tall.[CN 1] As a fire-based entity, 
            his body radiates high amounts of heat. His feet have a slight oval-like design with only two toes and 
            one back toe and he has somewhat large hands with bridged wrists.
            His tongue is also made of fire
            while his collarbone resembles a volcano which generates a fiery hair-like aura that covers his head, 
            leaving his mask-like face visible with no nose, ears, or pupils.</p> <br>

             and wears black pants. He has a green belt with white stripes on which he wears the Omnitrix symbol.
             Diamondhead no longer bears the crystals on his chest, and the crystals on his back have also grown in length.
             His jaw is larger, he wears black shoes that are green on the bottom, and there are now only two crystal shards on his back.
             His arms and shoulders also seem to have much more girth.</p> <br>
