             <dt>Is Eleven movie hit or flop? </dt>
                <dd>The Tamil movie Eleven, starring Naveen Chandra, 
                    is generally considered a decent crime thriller and
                     a modest success at the box office. While it's not
                      a blockbuster, it has garnered positive reviews for
                       its suspenseful plot, strong performances, and unique
                        narrative. Some reviewers have noted that the film's
                     predictability and missed opportunities prevent it from
                      being a truly outstanding film</dd>
